# RentRetreats
A house renting system where visitors can rent out their houses or/and rent available houses based on their roles. There are two main roles; tenant and host. Tenants can rent other houses, while hosts can additionally rent out their houses. In the application users can do CRUD-operations (create, read, update, delete) houses or/and reservations. Hosts can only update and delete their own houses. In addition there is also Admin, who can do all the operations on all the houses and reservations.
The application is implemented using the Model-View-Controller framework of .NET.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before running the application, you must run the command `dotnet restore` in the project terminal.
